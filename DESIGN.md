### Intro and motivation of our design 
In our initial planning phase, we brainstormed different features to create create for Covey.Town and felt that submaps would be a great feature to implement.  We tried our best to follow certain themes in our approach:

1. make use of the current functionality to our advantage
2. make our code/feature extensible such that it could have a lifecycle that could be continued after this project ends and more features can be created upon ours.

Given our constraints such as a short timeline, coming into a codebase that we havenâ€™t seen before, and learning the regular curriculum, we felt our submaps feature aligned with our approach and requirements for the project.

# State Changes
<!--State Changes Outline
1. Not sure if this is to be on it's own, OR will be discussed in the 
frontend:super/sub section.  Placed it here, since we discussed this section on Thurs.
Feel free to modify.

# (Need a better title: Code updates from Professor)
<!--Need a better title: Code updates from Professor Outline
1.We need to somehow explain why we did not take certain code from 
Professor Bell's updated code, OR had to modify it.
2.We did not use transporter code.
    - we made changes to our code by the time we saw the transporter code update and had
    to comment the update to make sure it did not interact with our current feature
    we were building.
    - List any other reasoning
3.Sprite fix (in upper left) update
    - updated code from Professor used the same naming convention for a field we 
    already had in use.
    - So we can explain what we did.

# For our Covey.Town v2 release: 
<!-- For our v2 Release Outline:
1. There were things that we had to intentionally leave for later
2. How did we handle issues outside of our use-cases?
    -We had a list in our meeting minutes and would have to 
    prioritize if those issues were optional vs. required.
    -Tried our best to prioritize the use cases as outlined in our plan
3. What would we do for the v2 release:
    -incorporate the transporter code.
    -spawn relocation for avatar from Submap->SuperMap, so it goes to entrance
    -(anything else)
